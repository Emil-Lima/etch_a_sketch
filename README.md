Project trying to *emulate* an etch-a-sketch.

Note that, when you click on the button and create your own grid, the game changes (on purpose), so now the colors are not random, but what it does is decreasing the lightness of the color by 10% each time you hover over a grid square, making it become complitely black by the 10th time you do so.
